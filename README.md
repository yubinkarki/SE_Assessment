Questions asked on the online/onsite assessment conducted by XYZ company for internship of Software Engineer.  

```
Question #1 - Search for Zero  

Write a program that takes multiple numbers as an input.
Return 'Yes' if the digit 0 appears anywhere in the array. 
Otherwise, return 'No'. 
The first input should be the count of the numbers to be provided. 
Each subsequent number will be part of the array. 
Each input should be provided in a new line.

Example:

Sample Input 1:
> 3  
> 1  
> 2  
> 205

Sample Output 1:
> Yes

Sample Input 2:
> 4  
> 1  
> 2  
> 3  
> 99

Sample Output 2:
> No
```

```
Question #2 - Shift the Vowels

Replace all vowels in a sentence with the next closest vowel in the sentence itself.
The last vowel should be replaced by the first vowel in the sentence.

Example:

Sample Input 1:
> Hello World

Sample Output 1:
> Hollo Werld
```

```
Question #3 - Encode and Decode

Write a program that takes a string as input.
Print either the encoded or decoded string.
Logic is provided with the question.

Encoding:  
Encoded string will only have characters and no digits.
Replace N consecutively repeated letters with the number N+2 followed by the letter (case sensitive).

Decoding:  
Decoded string will have both characters and digits.
It will reverse the encoding logic.

Example:

Sample Input 1 - Encoding:
> AAAAAAaaaXMMMMMMMMMMMM

Sample Output 1:
> 8A5a3X14M

Sample Input 2 - Decoding:
> 8A5a3X14M

Sample Output 2:
> AAAAAAaaaXMMMMMMMMMMMM  
```

```
Question #4 - Convert to Uppercase  

Take a string and convert all characters to uppercase.
Replace space by * except for any leading and trailing spaces.
Those spaces should be left as it is.

Example: (underscore means whitespace)

Sample Input 1:
> Hello_my_friend 

Sample Output 1:
> HELLO*MY*FRIEND  

Sample Input 2:
> __No_Way__

Sample Output 2:
> __NO*WAY__
```

```
Question #5 - Language of Pirates

A group of pirates created their own language which is different from normal English.
Write a program that takes a string as an input and prints the translated.

Pirate language:
Take the initial letter of ever word.
Move it to the end of the word.
Add "arg" at the end.

Note:  
> Punctuations should remain at the end of the word even after translation.
> Assume that punctuations won't appear anywhere other than the end of the word.
> Punctuations to be considered are ,:;?!.
> There could be multiple punctuations.(eg: Yes!!)

Example:

Sample Input 1:
> Take what you can, give nothing back. 

Sample Output 1:
> akeTarg hatwarg ouyarg ancarg, ivegarg othingnarg ackbarg.  
```

```
Question #6 - Find Common Letters

Write a program that takes multiple strings as input.
Print the number of common letters in all the strings.
The first input n represents the number of string inputs to be taken.
Each subsequent input will be a string.
Each input should be taken in a new line.  

Example:

Sample Input 1:
> 3  
> aeiouxyz  
> aumnpez  
> nmzea  

Sample Output 1:
> 3  
```

> Target = the  

Sample Output 1:
> 3  
```

> 15  
```

```
Question #9 - 2nd Highest Number
